# Table filled with Random Numbers

This is almost my first project. It's a simple html-page with simple animation with two buttons:
- the button `Create Table` is to create (or recreate) a table that populated with random numbers and have dimentions equal to 10 rows \u2715 12 columns;
- the button `Remove Table` is correspondingly to remove a table if there already exists one.
